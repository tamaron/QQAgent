## Features
 
QQAgent analyzes user input using the morphological analysis engine Mecab and generates responses based on the analysis results. It includes features such as speech input using Google Cloud Speech-To-Text, weather forecast search using OpenWeatherMap, and playful exploration using dynamic programming.

## Dependency
Unity 2020.3.5f1 (or higher)

## NOTE
It is currently not possible to build and run the application locally as it relies on web APIs that are not publicly available.
